Relevant Entrypoints\n\n### Core Types (src/lib/agent-activity-types.ts)\n| Symbol | Line | Purpose |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| `AgentActivityType` | 7 | Union type for event types: claimed, file_read, file_edit, command_run, commit, tool_use, etc. |\n| `AgentActivityEvent` | 21 | Core event interface with id, timestamp, type, projectId, agentId, plus type-specific fields |\n| `AgentActivityFilter` | 45 | Filter interface for querying events |\n| `getActivityIcon()` | 60 | Maps event type to feather icon name |\n| `getActivityColor()` | 78 | Maps event type to display color |\n\n### Activity Store (src/lib/agent-activity-store.ts)\n| Function | Line | Purpose |\n|----------|------|---------|\n| `addActivityEvent` | 36 | Add event to in-memory store, update agent status, notify listeners |\n| `updateAgentStatus` | 70 | Update agent status based on event type (working/idle/error) |\n| `queryEvents` | 105 | Filter events by project, issue, agent, type, time |\n| `subscribeToActivity` | 130 | Register listener for new events |\n| `getAgentStatuses` | 150 | Get current status of all agents |\n\n### API Endpoint (src/routes/api/projects/[id]/activity/stream/+server.ts)\n| Function | Line | Purpose |\n|----------|------|---------|\n| `GET` | 10 | SSE endpoint for streaming activity events |\n| `serializeEvent` | 85 | Convert Date to ISO string for JSON serialization |\n\n### UI Component (src/components/ActivityFeedPanel.svelte)\n| Feature | Lines | Purpose |\n|---------|-------|---------|\n| SSE Connection | 85-130 | Connect to activity stream, handle reconnection |\n| Pause/Resume | 140-147 | Queue events while paused, merge on resume |\n| Event Filtering | 45-55 | Filter by type and agent name |\n| Expand/Collapse | 149-157, 362-371 | Toggle detailed view of event properties |\n| Filter Controls | 281-301 | Dropdown selects for type and agent |\n\n## 2. Implementation Approach\n\n### Why In-Memory Store?\n- **Simplicity:** Events are transient, real-time monitoring doesn't need persistence\n- **Performance:** No disk I/O for high-frequency events\n- **Bounded:** MAX_EVENTS (1000) prevents memory bloat\n- **Listener Pattern:** Pub/sub for real-time UI updates\n\n### Data Flow\n```\nAgent Action → addActivityEvent() → In-memory store\n                                  → updateAgentStatus()\n                                  → Notify listeners\n                                        ↓\nSSE Endpoint → subscribeToActivity() → Push to clients\n                                        ↓\nActivityFeedPanel → EventSource → UI render\n```\n\n### UI Features Added (4bh.2)\n1. **Click to expand** - Shows detailed event properties (file paths, commands, tool info)\n2. **Filter by type** - Dropdown with all event types\n3. **Filter by agent** - Dropdown populated from seen events\n4. **Pause/resume** - Queues events during pause, merges on resume\n5. **Visual indicators** - Filter dot, queued badge, paused banner\n\n## 3. Open Decisions\n\n| Decision | Status | Notes |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| **Persistence** | DEFERRED | Currently in-memory only; could add JSONL logging |\n| **Event TTL** | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Events never expire, just capped at 1000 |\n| **Session filtering** | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Filter by session not yet added |\n| **Bead filtering** | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Filter by bead/issue not yet in UI |\n| **Timeline view** | NOT IMPLEMENTED | Could add horizontal timeline visualization |\n\n## 4. Current Progress\n\n### Completed Tasks\n- [x] 4bh.1: Define Activity Event Model (pre-existing in agent-activity-types.ts)\n- [x] 4bh.2: Activity Feed Panel with expand, filter, pause/resume\n\n### Integration Points\n- `TaskRunnerManager` emits events during agent execution\n- `ClaudeCliManager` could emit events (not yet integrated)\n- Events visible in OrchestrationView's agent activity panel\n\n## 5. Commands Run\n\n```bash\n# Closed EP5 tasks\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-4bh.1 --status=closed\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-4bh.2 --status=closed\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-4bh --status=closed\n\n# Build verification\nbun run build  # Success\n\n# Git commits\ngit commit -m \"Complete BC-EP5: Observability - Activity Feed enhancements\"\ngit push origin main  # 11f6061\n```\n\n**Errors Encountered:** None\n\n## 6.

Relevant Entrypoints\n\n### Core Types (src/lib/session-context-types.ts)\n| Symbol | Line | Purpose |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| `SessionStatus` | 21 | Union type: 'draft' \\| 'active' \\| 'paused' \\| 'closed' |\n| `Session` | 26 | Core session interface with id, projectId, beadId?, agentId?, status, timestamps, metrics |\n| `SessionMetrics` | 57 | Usage tracking: messageCount, tokens, cost, duration, toolCallCount |\n| `SessionMessage` | 103 | Chat message with role, content, toolCalls, usage stats |\n| `SessionSummary` | 135 | Lightweight session for list views |\n\n### Persistence Layer (src/lib/session-persistence.ts)\n| Function | Line | Purpose |\n|----------|------|---------|\n| `getSessionsDir` | 29 | Returns `.beads/sessions/` path |\n| `createSession` | 61 | Creates new session with draft status |\n| `saveSession` | 92 | Writes meta.json to disk |\n| `loadSession` | 106 | Reads meta.json from disk |\n| `listSessions` | 131 | Lists all sessions as summaries |\n| `appendMessage` | 172 | Appends to messages.jsonl, updates metrics |\n| `loadMessages` | 217 | Reads all messages from JSONL |\n| `transitionSession` | 254 | State machine enforcement |\n| `pauseSession` | 284 | Transition to paused |\n| `resumeSession` | 293 | Transition to active |\n| `closeSession` | 302 | Transition to closed with optional summary |\n\n### UI Components\n| Component | File | Purpose |\n|-----------|------|---------|\n| `SessionMetricsBar` | src/components/SessionMetricsBar.svelte | Displays session status, title, bead link, metrics, control buttons |\n| `SessionList` | src/components/SessionList.svelte | Sidebar list with filtering (all/active/closed) |\n\n### Legacy In-Memory Store (src/lib/session-store.ts)\n- `ChatSession` interface - still used by ChatSheet for runtime\n- `sessionStore` object - in-memory CRUD operations\n- **Note:** This coexists with new persistence layer; migration needed\n\n## 2. Implementation Approach\n\n### Why File-Based Persistence?\n- **Simplicity:** JSON files are human-readable and git-friendly\n- **Separation:** meta.json (quick reads) vs messages.jsonl (append-only)\n- **Portability:** Sessions can be shared/backed up easily\n- **No migration:** Doesn't require changes to existing beads.db schema\n\n### Storage Format\n```\n.beads/sessions/\n  {session-id}/\n    meta.json       # Session object (status, timestamps, metrics)\n    messages.jsonl  # One JSON message per line\n```\n\n### State Machine\n```\ndraft → active (first message) → paused ↔ active → closed\ndraft → closed (abandoned)\n```\n\n## 3. Open Decisions\n\n| Decision | Status | Notes |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| **Integration with ChatSheet** | PENDING | ChatSheet still uses in-memory session-store.ts; needs to call session-persistence.ts |\n| **Session resume on app restart** | PENDING | UI to select and resume previous sessions not wired up |\n| **Auto-title generation** | PENDING | Could use Claude to generate title from first few messages |\n| **Session cleanup/archival** | PENDING | No automatic cleanup of old closed sessions |\n| **Bead linkage enforcement** | PENDING | Sessions can reference beads but no bidirectional sync |\n\n## 4. Current Progress\n\n### Completed Tasks\n- [x] caf.1: Define Session Data Model\n- [x] caf.2: Implement Session Storage Layer\n- [x] caf.3: Session State Machine\n- [x] caf.4: Session Bar Component\n- [x] caf.5: Session List in Sidebar\n\n### Next 3 Steps (for integration)\n1. **Wire ChatSheet to persistence** - Call `createSession`/`appendMessage` from ChatSheet\n2. **Add SessionList to sidebar** - Display in project page sidebar\n3. **Implement session resume** - Load messages when switching sessions\n\n## 5. Commands Run\n\n```bash\n# Build verification\nbun run build  # Success - all components compile\n\n# Bead updates\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-caf.1 --status=closed\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-caf.2 --status=closed\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-caf.3 --status=closed\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-caf.4 --status=closed\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-caf.5 --status=closed\nbd update hlstc-dashboard-caf --status=closed\n\n# Git commits\ngit commit -m \"Implement BC-EP2: Session System core (caf.1, caf.2, caf.3)\"\ngit commit -m \"Implement BC-EP2 UI components (caf.4, caf.5)\"\n```\n\n**Errors Encountered:** None\n\n## 6. Known Issues Discovered\n\n| Issue | Severity | Notes |\n|-------|----------|-------|\n| **Dual session systems** | Medium | Both `session-store.ts` (in-memory) and `session-persistence.ts` (file) exist; need unification |\n| **No session ID in ChatSheet** | Low | ChatSheet doesn't expose session ID for persistence linkage |\n| **Messages not persisted** | Medium | Chat messages only in memory until persistence is wired |\n\n## 7. Key Files Changed\n\n```\nsrc/lib/session-context-types.ts  # +140 lines (Session, SessionMessage, etc.)\nsrc/lib/session-persistence.ts    # +350 lines (new file)\nsrc/components/SessionMetricsBar.svelte  # +190 lines (enhanced)\nsrc/components/SessionList.svelte  # +280 lines (new file)\n```\n\n## 8. Dependencies\n\n- `fs/promises` - File I/O\n- `crypto.randomUUID` - Session ID generation\n- No external npm packages added\n\n---\n*Context pack for session continuity across EP4 and beyond*\n","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:22:40Z"}]}

This phase transforms the generic dashboard into a context-aware workspace.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. Profile Detection \u0026 Selection\n- Auto-detect project type from file patterns (Package.swift → iOS, package.json → Web, terraform/*.tf → Infra)\n- Manual override option in project settings\n- Support custom profile definitions\n\n### 2. iOS Profile\n- **Quick Actions**: Build (xcodebuild), Test (XCTest), Run Simulator, Archive, SwiftLint\n- **Context Defaults**: Focus on *.swift, *.xib, *.storyboard, Package.swift\n- **CodeGraph Focus**: Classes, protocols, extensions, view controllers\n- **Suggested Agents**: iOS-architect, UIKit-specialist, SwiftUI-expert\n\n### 3. Web Profile (SvelteKit/React/Next.js)\n- **Quick Actions**: Dev server, Build, Test (vitest/jest), Lint, Type-check\n- **Context Defaults**: Focus on *.svelte, *.ts, *.tsx, routes/, components/\n- **CodeGraph Focus**: Components, hooks, routes, API endpoints\n- **Suggested Agents**: Frontend-architect, Component-designer, API-specialist\n\n### 4. Infrastructure Profile\n- **Quick Actions**: Terraform plan/apply, Ansible playbook, Docker build, K8s deploy\n- **Context Defaults**: Focus on *.tf, *.yml, Dockerfile, *.sh\n- **CodeGraph Focus**: Modules, resources, variables, outputs\n- **Suggested Agents**: DevOps-engineer, Security-reviewer, Cost-optimizer\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Profile type selector in project settings with auto-detection hint\n- [ ] Quick action bar appears in project header with profile-appropriate actions\n- [ ] Actions execute via Claude Code CLI with appropriate working directory\n- [ ] Context pack generation respects profile's default file patterns\n- [ ] Profile persists in project settings (localStorage or beads metadata)\n- [ ] Fallback \"Generic\" profile for unrecognized project types\n- [ ] Profile change updates UI immediately without page reload\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Data Model\n```typescript\ninterface ProjectProfile {\n  id: 'ios' | 'web' | 'infra' | 'generic' | string;\n  name: string;\n  detectionPatterns: string[];  // glob patterns\n  quickActions: QuickAction[];\n  contextDefaults: ContextPackDefaults;\n  suggestedAgents: string[];\n}\n\ninterface QuickAction {\n  id: string;\n  label: string;\n  icon: string;\n  command: string;  // executed via Claude Code CLI\n  requiresConfirmation?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n### UI Components\n- ProfileSelector.svelte - dropdown with auto-detect indicator\n- QuickActionBar.svelte - horizontal action buttons in project header\n- ProfileSettingsPanel.svelte - full profile configuration\n\n### Key Files to Modify\n- src/routes/(protected)/projects/[id]/+page.svelte - add quick action bar\n- src/components/ContextPacksPanel.svelte - integrate profile defaults\n- New: src/lib/profiles/ - profile definitions and detection logic","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-19T09:50:58.366418-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-19T16:26:30.021301-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T16:26:30.021301-06:00","close_reason":"completed","created_by":"Isaiah Peek"}

It covers user preferences, agent configuration, comprehensive settings, and integrated help resources.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. Agent Management\n- **Agent Registry**: List available Claude Code agents with descriptions\n- **Custom Agents**: Create project-specific agents with custom system prompts\n- **Agent Assignment**: Associate agents with specific beads or issue types\n- **Agent History**: Track which agents worked on which issues\n\n### 2. Settings UI\n- **Appearance**: Theme (light/dark/auto), font size, density (compact/comfortable)\n- **Behavior**: Auto-refresh interval, notification preferences, keyboard shortcuts\n- **Integrations**: Claude API key status, CodeGraph connection, Beads CLI path\n- **Data**: Export/import settings, clear cache, reset to defaults\n\n### 3. Customization Options\n- **Kanban Columns**: Show/hide columns, custom column ordering\n- **Card Display**: Choose visible fields (priority, labels, assignee, due date)\n- **Default Views**: Set preferred tab, filters, and sort order per project\n- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Customizable keybindings for common actions\n\n### 4. FAQ \u0026 Help Resources\n- **Integrated Help Panel**: Searchable FAQ within the dashboard\n- **Contextual Tips**: Smart tooltips explaining features on hover\n- **Onboarding Flow**: First-run walkthrough for new users\n- **Documentation Links**: Quick access to Beads, Claude Code, and dashboard docs\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Agent Management\n- [ ] Agent list panel showing available agents with descriptions\n- [ ] Create custom agent form with name, description, system prompt fields\n- [ ] Agent selector when starting a chat session\n- [ ] Agent activity visible in observability panel (connects to EP5)\n\n### Settings\n- [ ] Dedicated Settings page accessible from navigation\n- [ ] All settings persist to localStorage\n- [ ] Settings export as JSON, import validates schema\n- [ ] Reset button with confirmation dialog\n\n### Customization\n- [ ] Drag-to-reorder Kanban columns\n- [ ] Toggle card field visibility in settings\n- [ ] Saved filter presets per project\n\n### Help\n- [ ] Help icon in header opens FAQ panel\n- [ ] Cmd+? keyboard shortcut opens help\n- [ ] Search within FAQ content\n- [ ] \"What's New\" changelog accessible from help\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Data Model\n```typescript\ninterface DashboardSettings {\n  appearance: {\n    theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto';\n    fontSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';\n    density: 'compact' | 'comfortable';\n  };\n  behavior: {\n    autoRefreshMs: number;\n    notifications: boolean;\n    soundEnabled: boolean;\n  };\n  kanban: {\n    columnOrder: string[];\n    hiddenColumns: string[];\n    cardFields: string[];\n  };\n  shortcuts: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface CustomAgent {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  systemPrompt: string;\n  createdAt: string;\n  projectId?: string;  // null = global\n}\n```\n\n### UI Components to Create\n- SettingsPage.svelte - full settings UI with tabs\n- AgentManagerPanel.svelte - list/create/edit agents\n- CustomAgentForm.svelte - agent creation form\n- HelpPanel.svelte - FAQ and help content\n- KeyboardShortcutsPanel.svelte - shortcut customization\n- OnboardingModal.svelte - first-run experience\n\n### Key Integration Points\n- Settings stored in localStorage with version migration\n- Agents stored in beads metadata or local JSON\n- Help content can be markdown files loaded at runtime\n- Theme CSS variables for appearance changes","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-19T09:50:58.617441-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-19T17:43:56.590584-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T17:43:56.590584-06:00","close_reason":"EP7 complete: Implemented Settings page (appearance, skill level, data repair, export/import), Help Panel with searchable FAQ, keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+?, F1), custom quick actions, and column visibility.

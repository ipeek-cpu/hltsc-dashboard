# Session Wrap Up

Before ending this session, please:

1. **Summarize** what we accomplished today
2. **List any known issues** that were discovered (CI failures, blockers, bugs)
3. **Document next steps** for the next session
4. **Note any decisions** made during this session

This will help maintain context for future sessions.
